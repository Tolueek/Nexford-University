- Pandas
- R 4.x
- zipfile module (included in Python standard library)

## Python Instructions:
1. Import the salary data into the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Use the `get_employee_details()` function to retrieve employee details by name.
3. Export employee data to a CSV file and zip it into "Employee_Profile.zip".

## R Instructions:
1. Use the `unzip_and_display()` function in R to unzip the folder and display the employee data from the CSV file.

## How to Run:
- Run the Python code in Jupyter Notebook to process and export the data.
- Use R to unzip the "Employee_Profile.zip" and display the employee data.
